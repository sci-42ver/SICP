# 5.2 A Register-Machine Simulator

### Exercise 5.7:

Use the simulator to test the machines you designed in Exercise 5.4.

## 5.2.1 The Machine Model

## 5.2.2 The Assembler

### Exercise 5.8:

The following register-machine code is ambiguous, because the label here is defined more than once:

```
start
  (goto (label here))
here
  (assign a (const 3))
  (goto (label there))
here
  (assign a (const 4))
  (goto (label there))
there
```

With the simulator as written, what will the contents of register `a` be when control reaches `there`? Modify the `extract-labels` procedure so that the assembler will signal an error if the same label name is used to indicate two different locations.

## 5.2.3 Generating Execution Procedures for Instructions

### Exercise 5.9:

The treatment of machine operations above permits them to operate on labels as well as on constants and the contents of registers. Modify the expression-processing procedures to enforce the condition that operations can be used only with registers and constants.

### Exercise 5.10:

Design a new syntax for register-machine instructions and modify the simulator to use your new syntax. Can you implement your new syntax without changing any part of the simulator except the syntax procedures in this section?

### Exercise 5.11:

When we introduced `save` and `restore` in Section 5.1.4, we didnâ€™t specify what would happen if you tried to restore a register that was not the last one saved, as in the sequence

```scheme
(save y) (save x) (restore y)
```

There are several reasonable possibilities for the meaning of `restore`:

a. `(restore y)` puts into `y` the last value saved on the stack, regardless of what register that value came from. This is the way our simulator behaves. Show how to take advantage of this behavior to eliminate one instruction from the Fibonacci machine of Section 5.1.4 (Figure 5.12).

b. `(restore y)` puts into `y` the last value saved on the stack, but only if that value was saved from `y`; otherwise, it signals an error. Modify the simulator to behave this way. You will have to change `save` to put the register name on the stack along with the value.

c. `(restore y)` puts into `y` the last value saved from `y` regardless of what other registers were saved after `y` and not restored. Modify the simulator to behave this way. You will have to associate a separate stack with each register. You should make the `initialize-stack` operation initialize all the register stacks.

### Exercise 5.12:

The simulator can be used to help determine the data paths required for implementing a machine with a given controller. Extend the assembler to store the following information in the machine model:

- a list of all instructions, with duplicates removed, sorted by instruction type (`assign`, `goto`, and so on);

- a list (without duplicates) of the registers used to hold entry points (these are the registers referenced by `goto` instructions);

- a list (without duplicates) of the registers that are `saved` or `restored`;

- for each register, a list (without duplicates) of the sources from which it is assigned (for example, the sources for register `val` in the factorial machine of Figure 5.11 are `(const 1)` and `((op *) (reg n) (reg val))`).

Extend the message-passing interface to the machine to provide access to this new information. To test your analyzer, define the Fibonacci machine from Figure 5.12 and examine the lists you constructed.

### Exercise 5.13:

Modify the simulator so that it uses the controller sequence to determine what registers the machine has rather than requiring a list of registers as an argument to `make-machine`. Instead of pre-allocating the registers in `make-machine`, you can allocate them one at a time when they are first seen during assembly of the instructions.

## 5.2.4 Monitoring Machine Performance

### Exercise 5.14:

Measure the number of pushes and the maximum stack depth required to compute *n*! for various small values of *n* using the factorial machine shown in Figure 5.11. From your data determine formulas in terms of *n* for the total number of push operations and the maximum stack depth used in computing *n*! for any *n* > 1. Note that each of these is a linear function of *n* and is thus determined by two constants. In order to get the statistics printed, you will have to augment the factorial machine with instructions to initialize the stack and print the statistics. You may want to also modify the machine so that it repeatedly reads a value for *n*, computes the factorial, and prints the result (as we did for the GCD machine in Figure 5.4), so that you will not have to repeatedly invoke `get-register-contents`, `set-register-contents!`, and `start`.
