# 2.1 Introduction to Data Abstraction

## Exercise 2.1:

Define a better version of `make-rat` that handles both positive and negative arguments. `make-rat` should normalize the sign so that if the rational number is positive, both the numerator and denominator are positive, and if the rational number is negative, only the numerator is negative.

## Exercise 2.2:

Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a constructor `make-segment` and selectors `start-segment` and `end-segment` that define the representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the *x* coordinate and the *y* coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor `make-point` and selectors `x-point` and `y-point` that define this representation. Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a procedure `midpoint-segment` that takes a line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints). To try your procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:

```scheme
(define (print-point p)
    (newline)
    (display "(")
    (display (x-point p))
    (display ",")
    (display (y-point p))
    (display ")"))
```

## Exercise 2.3:

Implement a representation for rectangles in a plane. (Hint: You may want to make use of Exercise 2.2.) In terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectangle. Now implement a different representation for rectangles. Can you design your system with suitable abstraction barriers, so that the same perimeter and area procedures will work using either representation?

## Exercise 2.4:

Here is an alternative procedural representation of pairs. For this representation, verify that `(car (cons x y))` yields `x` for any objects `x` and `y`.

```scheme
(define (cons x y)
    (lambda (m) (m x y)))
(define (car z)
    (z (lambda (p q) p)))
```

What is the corresponding definition of `cdr`? (Hint: To verify that this works, make use of the substitution model of Section 1.1.5.)

## Exercise 2.5:

Show that we can represent pairs of nonnegative integers using only numbers and arithmetic operations if we represent the pair *a* and *b* as the integer that is the product 2<sup>a</sup>3<sup>b</sup>. Give the corresponding definitions of the procedures `cons`, `car`, and `cdr`.
