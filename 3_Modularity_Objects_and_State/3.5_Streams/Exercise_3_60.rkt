;; IMHO the above explanation doesn't say about the reasons behind. 
;; Actually, we just need to think about how to get the 1st item.
;; This is easy by using 2 car's. 
;; Then to get the 2nd item, we need cdr*car.
;; Then we can combine (cdr a)*(car b) and (cdr a)*(cdr b) together.
;; So only 3 items now.
