# 1.2 Procedures and the Processes They Generate

## Exercise 1.9:

Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures `inc`, which increments its argument by 1, and `dec`, which decrements its argument by 1.

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes iterative or recursive?

```scheme
; the first procedure
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc 8)
9

; the second procedure
(+ 4 5)
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ 3 6)
9
```

They are recursive.

## Exercise 1.10:

The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermannâ€™s function.

```scheme
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1))))))
```

What are the values of the following expressions?

```scheme
(A 1 10)
(A (- 1 1) (A 1 (- 10 1)))
(A 0 (A 1 9))
(* 2 (A 1 9))
(* 2 (A 0 (A 1 8)))
(* 2 (* 2 (A 1 8)))
(* 2 (* 2 (A 0 (A 1 7))))
; 2^10 = 1024

(A 2 4)
(A (- 2 1) (A 2 (- 4 1)))
(A 1 (A 2 3))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 2 2))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 1))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 1 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 (A 0 (A 1 1))))
(A 1 (A 1 (* 2 (A 1 1)))
(A 1 (A 1 (* 2 2)))
(A 1 (A 1 4))
(A 1 (A 0 (A 1 3)))
(A 1 (* 2 (A 1 3)))
(A 1 (* 2 (A 0 (A 1 2))))
(A 1 (* 2 (* 2 (A 1 2))))
(A 1 (* 2 (* 2 (A 0 (A 1 1)))))
(A 1 (* 2 (* 2 (* 2 2))))
(A 1 (* 2 (* 2 4)))
(A 1 (* 2 8))
(A 1 16)
(A 0 (A 1 15))
(* 2 (A 1 15))
(* 2 (A 0 (A 1 14)))
(* 2 (* 2 (A 1 14)))
(* 2 (* 2 (A 0 (A 1 13))))
(* 2 (* 2 (* 2 (A 1 13))))
; 2^16 = 65536

(A 3 3)
(A 2 (A 2 2))
(A 2 (A 1 (A 2 1)))
(A 2 (A 1 2))
(A 2 (A 0 (A 1 1)))
(A 2 (A 0 2))
(A 2 (* 2 2))
(A 2 4)
; 2^16 = 65536
```

Consider the following procedures, where `A` is the procedure defined above:

```scheme
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
```

Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the procedures `f`, `g`, and `h` for positive integer values of `n`. For example, `(k n)` computes 5n^2.

```scheme
(define (f n) (A 0 n))
(define (f n) (* 2 n))
; 2n

(define (g n) (A 1 n))
(define (g n) (A 0 (A 1 (- n 1))))
(define (g n) (* 2 (A 1 (- n 1))))
; 2^n

(define (h n) (A 2 n))
(define (h n) (A 1 (A 2 (- n 1))))
(define (h n) (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 (- (- n 1) 1)))))
; 2^(h (n - 1))
; 2^2^...2 (n of 2)
```
