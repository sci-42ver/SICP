### Exercise 4.55:

Give simple queries that retrieve the following information from the data base:

1. all people supervised by Ben Bitdiddle;

2. the names and jobs of all people in the accounting division;

3. the names and addresses of all people who live in Slumerville.

### Exercise 4.56:

Formulate compound queries that retrieve the following information:

a. the names of all people who are supervised by Ben Bitdiddle, together with their addresses;

b. all people whose salary is less than Ben Bitdiddle’s, together with their salary and Ben Bitdiddle’s salary;

c. all people who are supervised by someone who is not in the computer division, together with the supervisor’s name and job.

### Exercise 4.57:

Define a rule that says that person 1 can replace person 2 if either person 1 does the same job as person 2 or someone who does person 1’s job can also do person 2’s job, and if person 1 and person 2 are not the same person. Using your rule, give queries that find the following:

a. all people who can replace Cy D. Fect;

b. all people who can replace someone who is being paid more than they are, together with the two salaries.
