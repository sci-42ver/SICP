I skipped [Problem Sets](https://github.com/abrantesasf/sicp-abrantes-study-guide?tab=readme-ov-file), Exam, homework and Quizzes because IMHO those numerous exercises in the book is enough and most of courses pay more attention for projects when grading. Also 
- see [this](https://github.com/junqi-xie-learning/SICP-Projects?tab=readme-ov-file) (Here [one fork](https://github.com/junqi-xie-learning/SICP-Projects/forks) may be itself)

[6.001 fall 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20160306110531/http://sicp.csail.mit.edu/Fall-2007/) which seems to be the last 6.001 course based on sicp as [this][mit_End_of_an_Era_comment] and 6.037 reference imply. (But 6.037 uses 6.001 spring 2007 ~~which~~ ~~may be preferable~~ because fall 2007 lecture notes aren't public)

- lecture corresponding chapter see 6.037 description.
- > These online lectures will generally cover the same material, but are *NOT guaranteed to be identical to the material covered in the live* lectures, and in some cases there may *not be a corresponding online version of the live* lecture.
- As [this](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/syllabus.html) shows, both book and lectures have contents that the other doesn't have. So we need to read them all.

It seems to only have video lectures
> we have engaged in a major educational experiment in which the lectures were replaced with online lectures, to which students were *expected to listen*, either in the 6.001 lab, or on their own computer. ... but that material will *not be identical to the live* lectures.
#### recitations
~~I~~ ~~don't have time to find that difference and also the lecture is old.~~ ~~will only do the~~ [recitations](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jastr/6001/fall07/) which is based on the video lecture.
Better read this if possible because this course is [taught by Gerald Jay Sussman](https://web.archive.org/web/20160415061035/http://sicp.csail.mit.edu/Fall-2007/staff.txt).
> Lectures are the primary vehicle for introducing and motivating new material, some of which is *not in the book*. It is essential that you *listen to the lectures* (whether live – which we prefer – or online), as the *recitations will assume you have already heard the material*, and will *build upon it*. ... Recitations *expand* upon the material currently being introduced in lecture, as well as introducing supplementary material that is *not directly covered in lecture*. ... your attendance at recitation is *essential to good performance* in this class.
#### problem set
I can't find by "6.001 fall 2007 Problem set site:mit.edu" which may be implied by

> *failing to prepare ahead* for programming assignments generally ensures that the assignments will *take much longer* than necessary
#### collaboration (this is similar to one description I read before)
> For example, your partner has a bug on one part, and you are able to point out where the bug is and how to fix it.
inappropriate
> this is inappropriate collaboration because you were *not both involved in all aspects* of the work
#### Workload
> In addition, please be aware that prolonged computer usage combined with *poor posture or improper typing habits* can result in conditions such as *repetitive strain injury*.
#### bible (See the bold text)
#### tutor
They are for tutorial's.
> If you are unable to attend a tutorial, you should contact your tutor in advance to make alternate arrangements for that week.

To join this it seems that we must be one mit student and [request a form (this is from the chemistry department)](https://chemistry.mit.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-programs/tutoring/). This is also implied in spring 2007 6.001 lec01 p2.

    > When I’m not taking the corresponding class in person, I take a similar approach to reading the book, but *only after I’ve watched the lectures and read through the notes*. ... I’d resort to notes from *other professors* (sometimes not from MIT) before I’ll read the book.

  - think better than writing mere notes.

  - > Unlike the homework and projects, the *tests* in this course (except for the parts specifically designated as group parts) must be your own, individual work

  >  You almost certainly *missed out on things* that you could very well *never see again*, or even know the existence of (at least for a very long time)
  kw: metaprogramming, macros, 
  > This is something you can't even dream of doing in most (all?) languages that *aren't dialects of LISP*.
  - [2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9843053)
    > The first 1/3 of CS61A in scheme had *no mutation*. That is almost impossible in Python to do, and is not the way the language is used in industry
    Python is to help the majority of struggling students
    > but perhaps fail to grasp some of the more complex concepts ... 80% of the material hasn't changed but you've gained the above benefits
    > If you understood the intricacies of what *was* taught in CS61A, you will find it very easy to *generalize* those concepts to *new languages* - and new concepts.
So I skip [this python lesson 6.100](https://introcomp.mit.edu/spring24/information)
### lab
recommended since the course general information shows (more detailed see 1.md)
> Laboratory exercises are short, relatively simple exercises designed to *introduce a new topic*.

### update [Course Reader vol 1](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/)
## cs61as
The latest should be CS "61AS" spring 2016 since 'CS "61AS" fall 2016' has nothing.
I only check labs without checking Homework, Quizzes and Retakes
- Syllabus

  - > Lessons also link to external readings drawn from *SICP and old CS 61A lecture notes*'
  - "Units" shows the corresponding book chapters.
- Suggested Schedule & All Deadlines don't give project corresponding chapters
  So by Syllabus and textbook, maybe project x corresponds to chapter x.
- FAQ doesn't have much about what to be learnt.
- the following needs university student account
  - Discussion Worksheets and Solutions
- Webcasts fails now.
- Legacy Resources -> Lecture Notes may point to cs61a

### reading

## video
- what video [actually needs to do](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/52758)
  > The advantage of the human teacher is that I *can ask questions*, but of course a video teacher cannot answer. There are cases, of course, where a video is superior to a printed book: a video can *show action* that a book can only describe or perhaps show still photos. So if you want to learn how to *perform some physical action*, like how to play golf or replace a transmission filter or whatever, a video might be able to show you in ways that *a book could not.*
- video lectures should [not be dependent more than the book](https://qr.ae/psJ39d). 
  Also [see](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8tn6pv/comment/e18s63p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
  - [this](https://qr.ae/psJBAi) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/oll49b/comment/h5g0fel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) says video is *only as one companion* but not the main part.
## summary
- [detailed][academia_se_tips]
  1. not drop one part artificially.
  2. better read the *lecture before* the book to get the *main idea*
  3. spend "~90% of their time working problems". (Although ~90 may be too high for actual course learning.)
- choose [the favorable method](https://mitili.mit.edu/news/compared-reading-how-much-does-video-improve-learning-outcomes) to learn
  > Likewise, those who *preferred to read and did read* scored nearly 10 percent *higher* on the post assessment than participants in the video group who would have preferred to read.

# How Do I learn SICP
- I read
  - lectures (I skipped Recitation because they are only review with no new knowledge to teach) first as [academia_se_tips] point 2 shows.
    - 6.037 (not read "With slide transitions" which is for lecture ppt instead of self-study)
    - 6.001 2007
  - read the book
  - use video when unable to understand

# chapter 1
## 6.037 (dropped for future reading except this one already read)
- [web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/](https://web.archive.org/web/20200113183359/http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/)
- [Graduate P/D/F](https://registrar.mit.edu/classes-grades-evaluations/grades/grading-policies/graduate-pdf-option) is *not one standard* option
- TODO
  - [TR](https://kb.mit.edu/confluence/display/glossary/TR) meaning in "TR, 7-9PM"
- Newton's method (i.e. approximation based on derivative) -> Heron's method [proof](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1733394/1059606)
  notice here we can't use $f(x)=\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{2},x\mapsto x-\frac{\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{2}}{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}}=2\sqrt{2x}-x$ where the mapped result contains $\sqrt{2}$ which is what ~~since~~ we want to calculate~~$\sqrt{2}$~~.
- [shire album book series](https://www.somethingunderthebed.com/CURTAIN/SHIRE_ALBUM.html)
  - TODO does the author have one website (search by "Calculating Machines and Computers Geoffrey Tweedale page")?
- TODO what is silicon well, Higgs field?
- TTODO which means it must be understood for further study.
  - `#<procedure:+>`
- I installed mit-scheme using aur which is [updated](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/dont-panic/#org1107e7f)
- > Why can’t "if" be implemented as a regular lambda procedure?
  because lambda is [*sequential*](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/stable/mit-scheme-ref/Lambda-Expressions.html)
  > the exprs in the body of the lambda expression are evaluated sequentially in it
  - `expr expr` in the above link may be no use. But `define` [may use that](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47166401/21294350).
  - I don't find "regular lambda" in [the video transcript](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/resources/1b-procedures-and-processes-substitution-model/)
- > How do we know it works?
  It only shows one big iteration step where 2 in `(lambda (a b) (/ (+ a b) 2)) 1.0 2` should be ` (/ x guess)`.
- > But, it only solves a smaller version of the problem
  may mean the false `(fact 0)`. p53 is same as Figure 1.3.
- > Better idea: count up, doing one multiplication at a time
  compared with "recursive algorithms", the latter only manipulates with the stack without doing the arithmetic.
- > output value
  may be "output*s* value".
- > express in tabular form
  See p57.
## 6.001 sp07
IMHO 6.037 is the condensed (as its main page says) of 6.001 lectures by removing many figures.
*Seriously* 6.037 drops "Proving that our code works" in lec 3 which is important although this will be learned in the future.
### 1
- TODO
  - > Could just store tons of “what is” information
- kw:
  - robustness and [flexibility](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flexibility-vs-security-in-system-design/) which may be probably said in COD.
- [higher order procedure](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ssch8/higher.html#:~:text=A%20function%20that%20takes%20another,%E2%80%94a%20higher%2Dorder%20procedure.)
- > Use a language to describe processes
  See [this (I only read the context of "process")](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/142870/161388)
  >  figure the most *important elements to formalize* and how they interact with each other
- > This creates a loop in our system, can create a complex thing, name it, treat it as primitive
  then one complex thing based on that new primitive ... primitive ...
### rec2 (naming follows 6.001 fall 2007)
- > Names may be made of any collection of characters that doesn’t start with a number.
  [See](https://www.scheme.com/tspl2d/intro.html)
  > Identifiers normally cannot start with any character that may start a number, i.e., a digit, plus sign ( + ), minus sign ( - ), or decimal point ( . ).
### 2
- Rumplestiltskin effect just means [naming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumpelstiltskin#Rumpelstiltskin_principle).
- > Next lecture, we will see a formal way of tracing evolution of evaluation process
  in lec 3 p4 it is not that formal but just listing all stages.
  induction is more formal.
### 3 Procedures, recursion
- > E.g. keep trying, but bring sandwiches and a cot
  This may mean it will take a long time.
  Also see [similar words with the different meaning (3 Hots & A Cot)](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=3%20hots%20and%20a%20cot)
### rec3 recursion
1. [ ] count1 from n to 0 and count2 from 0 to n.
  - `0` is not displayed by `our-display`.
```bash
1 ]=> (count1 4)
4321
;Value: 0 # here is output by the last (= x 0) 0

1 ]=> (count2 4)    
1234
;Value: 4 # here is output by the last (our-display 4)
```
2. [x] is solved by the lec
3. [ ] use $\lim_{n\to \infty^+}(1+\frac{1}{n})^n$?
  Then $n=1e^{input}$ where `input=-100`, etc.
4. [x] see code
5. [ ] I originally planned to use base case for `n=1,2`.
  The solution is more elegant to use implicitly the 0th number being 0 although in the actual series that doesn't exist.
1. [ ] See https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/golden-ratio.html. See the approximation formula said in mcs p1005.

TODO read Lecture 5,6 & 6.001 in perspective & The Magic Lecture in 6.037 which don't have corresponding chapters in the book. Also read [~~Lectures without corresponding sections~~](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/pages/readings/) ([6.001 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20161201165314/http://sicp.csail.mit.edu/Spring-2007/calendar.html) is almost same as 2005 and they are both taught by [Prof. Eric Grimson](https://orgchart.mit.edu/leadership/vice-president-open-learning-interim-and-chancellor-academic-advancement/biography)).
